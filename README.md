# Advanced Website Fraud Detector / Detection
Finding ways to detect website fraud / scam with multiple methods. 

# Introduction
There are plenty of websites made to aquire personal information and most importantly credit card information. However, with modern detection methods some can slip through the radar and seem legitimate. My interesting detection methods will catch website scams that could potentially save you the stress and hassle! 


How does it work, you may ask? It checks for various things that make a website "scam" and adds to a percentage counter that will determine if the website given is a scam or not! It uses pure mathmatical algorithms combined with my own magic :)


From 0% (obvious scam) to 100% (safe), 50% could be scam or not.


`Q: I tried to test my site, but your algorithm says my website below 50%!`

A: Then there must be something making your site look and seem like a scam. The algorithm thinks like me if I was the one checking + magic, and if I think your website is a scam, you must re-assess your website.

`Q: I am running a legitimate business. How can I improve my score if your program / software is closed-source?`

A: Contact me, and I will let you know how to improve your website score. Be ready to prove you run a legitimate business.

`Q: My site is a scam but your algorithm said it was legit >:)`

A: False positives can still go through, but. I am consistently updating this so in a couple of weeks or less your website score WILL go low.



There is a dilemma with open-source anti-fraud technologies. If a malicious actor is able to reverse the source-code, they could easily hide from detection. So most functions will be encrypted for security purposes. It is a cat and mouse game!

If you want the raw source code (without the encryption), you will need to be a organization wanting to hire me or interested in my work :)
